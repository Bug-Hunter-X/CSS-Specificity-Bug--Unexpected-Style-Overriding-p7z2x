Several solutions can address the specificity issue in the provided CSS code:

**1. Using the `!important` flag (generally discouraged):**

While functional, using `!important` is generally discouraged due to potential maintainability issues and decreased readability. However, in exceptional situations where you need an absolute override, this could be used.

```css
div {
  color: blue !important;
}

.my-class {
  color: red !important;
}

#my-id {
  color: green !important;
}

#my-id.my-class {
  color: purple;
}
```

**2. Adjusting the CSS order (can be less predictable):**

The order in which CSS rules are declared can influence which rules take precedence. However, it's less reliable for complex situations and harder to maintain.

```css
#my-id.my-class {
  color: purple;
}

#my-id {
  color: green;
}

.my-class {
  color: red;
}

div {
  color: blue;
}
```

**3. More specific selectors (recommended):**

The best solution is usually to use more specific selectors to ensure that the intended styles are applied correctly and predictably. This approach yields predictable and maintainable code.

```css
/* Use more specific selectors to avoid conflicts */
```
